# SuperAdvancedCustomFields
A wrapper framework on top of Advanced Custom Fields Pro. 

This framework is designed as a WordPress Plugin to make using ACF much easier and more flexible as a developer.

This is meant for developers and will not offer much for designers or end users by itself.

ACF pro is bundled with this plugin.

I will be adding full documentation and a plugin update server in the future.
